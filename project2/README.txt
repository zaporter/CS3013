Project 2

This is my work for project 2. All code is contained in main.c and is compiled to the file "memorymanager". Accepted commands: map, store, read. 

Everything was build as per the specifications provided by Professor Walls with the exception of exact output formatting

Example input:
    testInput.txt
Example output:
    exampleOutput.txt

Eviction strategy:
    -- Dont evict if pages are already in
    -- Dont evict if table is already in and there is enough space for another page
    -- Evict pages of process if there is not enough space for another  
    -- Evict pages if there is not enough space for new table and new page
